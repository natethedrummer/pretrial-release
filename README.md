# Harris County Bail Research

## Problem  
Bail practices across the United States are unsafe, unfair, and ineffective.  Poor people are locked up while rich people pay to get out of jail. This is a timely issue.  [Courts are deciding](http://www.texasmonthly.com/the-daily-post/harris-county-case-end-cash-bail-know/ "Article") whether Harris County bail practices are unconstitutional. 

## Solution  
Working with [Themis Research](http://themisresearch.org/ "Themis Research") to sift through Harris County arrest and disposition records to determine whether there is discrimination in the bail system.
